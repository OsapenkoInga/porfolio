									We work with our local farmers, growers and purveyors to source products
									with integrity, flavor and soul, and incorporate these seasonal offerings into
									our menus nightly. The result is food that is honest, straightforward and 
									pays homage to the bounty of the Lowcountry region we are so privileged to
									call home. Using ingredients at their peak and preparing them minimally 
									and with respect allows us to capture the essence of the season and bring it
									straight to your table.

								<span>
										After leaving behind a short-lived television and film career to focus on the 
										food and beverage industry, Adam Nemirow spent the early part of his career 
										working in numerous kitchens, bars, and dining rooms in California, 
										Colorado, and Rhode Island. 
								</span>		
								<span>		
										“I had worked just about every restaurant job out there while trying to figure 
										out the direction I was headed professionally,” says Nemirow. “I finally
										realized that I loved the restaurant industry and wanted to take it all the
										way.”
								</span>	
								<span>	
										
										Nemirow started crafting plans for a simple, neighborhood restaurant with a
										focus on great food and a comfortable, laid-back atmosphere. Determined to
										learn everything he could about the business in a short time, he traveled to
										Paris to attend Le Cordon Bleu, and later earned his MBA in Restaurant
										Management from Johnson & Wales University in Providence, RI.

								</span>		
								<span>		
										After planting roots in Charleston in 2001, Nemirow became Manager
										at Anson Restaurant, where he had the opportunity to work side-by-side with 
										then Executive Chef Mike Lata. The two began a conversation about a unique
										restaurant that would feature simple, seasonal, food in a sociable, 
										unpretentious setting. In 2003, that idea became a reality with the birth of 
										FIG.
								</span>		
								<span>				
										Nemirow joins Lata in the charge to avidly support local farmers, fishermen, 
										and suppliers, and is passionate about how FIG contributes to the community.
										Nemirow oversees the restaurant’s wine and spirits, which is based on offering
										a wide variety of interesting and noteworthy wines of value, while taking into
										account current trends and popularity.  On any given night, you will find
										Nemirow presiding over the dining room at FIG, always striving to create an 
										environment that people want to return to again and again.
